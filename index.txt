<td align="center"> I was one of the people that joined the Folk dance Competition that 
represented our level. I am thankful that I was able to expereince this, and gained more friends
through this event and won 1st Runner-Up. It was a series of hardships leading up to the event but we were able to
surpass everything with the help of our MAPEH teacher.

                    With the effort of my team, their dedication and input, we were able to 
                    finish our film, and submit it on time. We filmed at my mother's school
                    because my mother is a teacher.

<td align="center">WHEN: FEBRUARY 1, 2024<br>(CLUSTER MEET)<br>
                  WITH: LPSCI WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL TEAM  
</td>
<td align="center">The cluster meet is my all time favorite memory in my Grade 9 journey.
                   I was recruited to play as the libero in the LPsci Women's Volleyball Team.
                   I remember starting training right after school and going home late at night.
                   All of the efforts and sacrifices were all worth it as we were able to win
                   First Runner-Up in that meet. Although, we were sad that we didn't bring home
                   the title, I am thankful that we were able to play for our school.<br><br>
                   I was nervious because it was my first time representing the school, let alone
                   playing volleyball, but in the end, I am thankful for the experience. I 
                   look forward to next year so that I will be able to play again. 
                   I am thankful for Sir Santos, if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have been able
                   to discover my talent and passion for volleyball.
                   I am thankful for my teammates for being supportive and patient, but especially 
                   to Ate Kimisha Fuentes, because she was always there for me. She always 
                   accompanied me when going home late.<br><br>
                   I am forever thankful for this experience, for I was able to make connections
                   with people who have the same passion and goal as I have. They are forever my 
                   "OA ATES". I will continue to strive for them even after they gradute, I will
                   work to bring home the title, for the school, for my ates, and for Sir Santos.

<td align="center">This magazine was a performance task in MAPEH in which we were
                   tasked to make a selfie of ourselves as a theater character.
                   I dressed up as Desdemona in the theater "Otello".<br><br>
                   She was the main protagonist in the play. It was a tragic love story
                   between her and her husband who comitted suicide.
